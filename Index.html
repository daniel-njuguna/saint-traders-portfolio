                <h2>journey and Experince</h2>
                <p>It all started2 years ago when I heard about forex trading. Simply, This is just exchange of foeighn currencies. After a great inspiration and research my forex journey began. I used to seak free education from youtube and other sources of learning. The journey was tough but we kept moving forward irregardless of the difficulties we faced. After one of learning, I had build an edge in trading. This is also in the organisation who were also educated and well informed about the markets. This is the time when the Saint Traders youth organisation was formed. 
                    For the past 1 year, we have been trading on small accounts which are between 100-500 dollars, this is because some of us are from disadvantaged families who are also not informed about Foreign exchange. We have proven constituency in trading for two years upto date. This is clear evident in our journey process and the acconts history and perfomance. The following are the accounts Id's and their respective brokerage firms which are proven. Skip 5 fields to fill the Id's</p>

                <h2>Hedge fund</h2>
                <p>The Hedge Fund will have at least $600,000 USD within one year, distributed among accounts, each worth dollars. The goal is to have 20 accounts fully funded. For each account, there is a registration fee of dollars to process, amounting to $2000 USD for the challenge.
                    The Hedge Fund will also accommodate liquidity from willing investors with a minimum return per investment of per month for every $200,000 invested. This approximate investment yields a 10% return.
                    The goal for this Prop Firm is to achieve a 20% return on accounts. This would amount to per month X $600,000 USD = $120,000 USD per account. In one year, this would total $1,200,000 USD for the first account.
                    For 10 accounts, the total monthly return would be $120,000 X 10 = $1,200,000 USD per month.</p>

                <p>Statement for Account # ENO 16630-58052012 - Exners Brokers

                    • The process link to our website, where the attached document has been placed at the end of this copy, can also be accessed by some of our friends and relatives. Since we come from disadvantaged families, some of the profits gained have been used to help our families.                   
                    • Two months ago, we were able to challenge accounts worth $100,000 USD in a fund. After the challenge, the fund, known as "My Forex Propfirm," experienced a crash, and the fee that we had paid was no longer recoverable. In total, we had invested $1,000 as a chargeable fee for the challenge. At the moment, we are working with small accounts worth $100 and $500.                   
                    • My major aim as the founder member of The Saint Traders is to come up with a great hedge fund in the form of a pool of liquidity, including liquidity funds, for traders and investors.  
                    • The following part will provide more details on our hedge fund.
